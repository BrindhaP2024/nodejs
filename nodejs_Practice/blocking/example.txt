Blocking: 
---> A blocking operation halts the execution of the program until it completes its task. 
---> It blocks the event loop,
meaning other operations cannot proceed until the current one finishes.

Non-Blocking: 
---> A non-blocking operation allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the operation to finish. 
--->It does not block the event loop, making it ideal for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading files, making network requests).
